## ðŸ’¾ Installation

**1. Initially, ensure your OPL folder is structured like this on your Device or in your Shared folder**
```
APPS/
ART/
CD/
CFG/
CHT/
DVD/
POPS/
THM/
VMC/
```

**2. Download one of the zip files that contains one of the Theme variants from the [Releases](https://github.com/PixeliGer/OPL-Theme-Pixel-Prime/releases/latest) page or using the green `DOWNLOAD` button at the top, (make sure it's one with the `thm_` prefix in its name)**
```
thm_PadOS
thm_PadOS-S
thm_PadOS-WIDE
thm_PadOS-S-WIDE
```

**3. Extract the ZIP file and move the theme folder to your `THM` directory.**
```
THM/
â”œâ”€ thm_PadOS/
â”œâ”€ thm_PadOS-S/
â”œâ”€ thm_PadOS-WIDE/
â”œâ”€ thm_PadOS-S-WIDE/
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Themes must be placed inside a folder named `THM` (in uppercase) for any of the devices: SMB share, HDD, USB, SD (MX4SIO), once the device starts, OPL will list the themes found in these locations

* **SMB** (Network Share)

In the root directory or drive you set as your PS2SMB share, in a THM folder

```
PS2SMB/THM/thm_PadOS/
```

* **USB**, **SD** device

In the root of the drive or partition set for OPL, in a THM folder

```
mass:/THM/thm_PadOS/
```

* **HDD** (Internal hard drive)

Place the THM folder in the `OPL Partition` of the HDD `+OPL`, you can create the partition if it doesn't exist, by using `uLaunchELF`: [FileBrowser > MISC > HddManager]

```
hdd0:/+OPL/THM/thm_PadOS/
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Themes on any of these devices wonâ€™t display unless the device is enabled, so make sure to enable the device where your themes are stored through the OPL settings.

> [!WARNING]
> Avoid installing themes on the Memory Card, as their storage size can impact the proper functioning of the themes and cause issues with OPL.


**4. Launch OPL, if it was already open, restart it.**

**5. Go to OPL Settings and then `Display Settings`. In the `Theme` option, find and select your theme, then click `OK` to apply it.**


## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations

To enhance your experience with the theme, consider these recommendations:

* To ensure proper and optimal viewing, activate the `Widescreen` mode for **Widescreen** versions and deactivate it for normal versions in `OPL Settings`
* Make sure you are using an updated or recent version of [Open Ps2 Loader 1.2](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader/releases/tag/latest)
* Download the assets for the `ART` folder (Background Image, Cover, Disc Cover, etc.) using the latest version of [OPL Manager](https://oplmanager.com/site/)
